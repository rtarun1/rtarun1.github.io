The work involves using a stereo camera, LiDAR and GNSS reciever for autonomously navigation in unknown environments.</p> <p>Engaging in these projects, I have gained experiance in SLAM, sensor fusion, computer-vision, machine learning, ROS, embedded systems, electronics and Mehcnaical fabrication. Please checkout <a href="/assets/pdf/my_resume.pdf">my resume</a> for additional information about my work.</p> <p>With my passion for harnessing the power of interdisciplinary robotic systems to tackle real-world challenges, I aim to create robots that do the Dull, Dirty &amp; Dangerous jobs.</p> <p>I am currently on the lookout for Research Internship Opportunities starting May 2024! Please reach out if you think I would be a good fit for your team.</p> </body></html>
