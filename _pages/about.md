I am intreseted in creating robots that aid humans in their day-today-day activities, like the recent project that I am building from ground up Autonomous Wheelchair - that aims to provide mobility solution to people with physical inabilities. The work involves using a stereo camera, LiDAR and GNSS reciever for autonomously navigation in unknown environments.

Engaging in these projects, I have gained experiance in SLAM, sensor fusion, computer-vision, machine learning, ROS, embedded systems, electronics and Mehcnaical fabrication. Please checkout [my resume](/assets/pdf/my_resume.pdf) for additional information about my work.

With my passion for harnessing the power of interdisciplinary robotic systems to tackle real-world challenges, I aim to create robots that do the Dull, Dirty & Dangerous jobs. 

I am currently on the lookout for Research Internship Opportunities starting May 2024! Please reach out if you think I would be a good fit for your team.
