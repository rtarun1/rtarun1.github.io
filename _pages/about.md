I'm interested in developing robots that help humans with their daily tasks, such as the Autonomous wheelchair, which I'm now designing from the ground up to provide mobility options to persons with physical limitations. The project entails using a stereo camera, LiDAR, and GNSS receiver to navigate autonomously in unforeseen areas.

Through these projects, I gained experience with SLAM, sensor fusion, computer vision, machine learning, ROS, embedded systems, electronics, and mechanical fabrication. Check out my résumé for more information about my work.

With my passion for using multidisciplinary robotic systems to solve real-world problems, my goal is to build robots that do the dull, dirty, and dangerous jobs.

I am now looking for research internship opportunities starting in May 2024! Please contact me if you believe I might be a good fit for your team.
